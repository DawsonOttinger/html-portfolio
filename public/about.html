<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a University student studying computer science, set to graduate in May of 2025. I have always had a passion for electronics and computers, which led me to begin my career in IT while enlisted in The United States Marine Corps. From 2015-2022, I served under a number of different titles gaining experience in Network Administration, Cisco Call Manager, Key Management Infrastructure/ COMSEC Management, and Helpdesk Management.</p>

<p>After my time in the military, I decided that it was time to further my career and decide which part of IT I wanted to be doing. I fell in love with programming and decided to embark on this painful, but rewarding experience. I am still trying to decide what I want to focus in, whether it be Full Stack development or focusing on Software I look forward to growing in this community and sharing my craft with you.</p>
